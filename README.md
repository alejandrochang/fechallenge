In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Suggestions
- Finish some of the functionality that is missing
  - Clicking on checkbox
  - handling multiple usernames
  - re-requesting the api
- Potentially update the user info cards - taking care of the needs of the API as it changes ex. users img url etc.
- Restructure the folder structure a bit especially as our code base grows
- Consistency across styling, code style
